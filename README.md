# SpaceX_Classification_Repo
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.
***I have used four classification models for this project which are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and K Nearest Neighbors.***
*** The steps that I have done for this project:
 * Exploratory Data Analysis and determining Training Labels
 * Splitting data into features and target
 * Standardizing features 
 * Splitting into training data and test data 
 * Finding best Hyperparameter for Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decission Trees, and K Nearest Neighbors
 * Finding the method which performs best using test data.
